# TRAFCO

Our website consists of 2 models: 
1) Traffic Signal Optimization: By processing live videos via CCTV footages on the streets we check the car density on each lane. Then after collecting the real-time data for 30 sec from the angle where the red light is facing or opposite to it. After 15 min we change the timings to be given to each of the traffic signals by giving higher priority to the lane which has a higher density of cars.
2) Connecting cars: This module has been created with the intention of assisting the ambulances in taking their patients to the hospital on time. Once the ambulance defines its path to the hospital on the basis of its real time location all the cars within a distance of 1km in front of its defined path with get an alert SMS notifying that there is an ambulance wanting to come through and the direction the car should move to.
